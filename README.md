Advent of Code in Typescript, using [bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun).

# Usage

We're using the test runner to solve puzzles.

Run tests once

```
bun run test
```

Watch, typecheck and run


```
bun run watch
```

# Interactive

Yeah, we play sounds. When the tests succeed, we play a happy sound. If linting fails, a less happy one. If the tests fail, a truly devastating sound.

It's fun. Why doesn't everyone do this?
